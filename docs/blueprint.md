## Core Features:

- IFC File Upload & Parsing: Upload and parse IFC files to extract building component data for analysis.
- 3D Model Visualization: Display the IFC model in an interactive 3D viewer (web-ifc-viewer) with selectable components.
- AI-Powered Chat Assistant: Implement a chat module connected to OpenAI GPT, providing context-aware feedback and guidance based on user questions, incorporating statics, energy, and accessibility input as a tool.
- Sustainability Analysis (LCA): Match IFC components to ÖKOBAUDAT entries, calculate environmental indicators (GWP, PEnr), and export the assessment, referencing EN 15978
- Material Passport Generation: Generate a material passport and JSON-based documentation of project components, using data gathered in the LCA process.
- Data Integration: Integration of external databases, such as ÖKOBAUDAT and EPD databases for the purpose of fetching relevant data and performing calculations related to the BIM models.
