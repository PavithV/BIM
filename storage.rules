/**
 * @fileoverview Firebase Storage Security Rules for BIMCoach Studio.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model, ensuring that users can only access and modify files that belong to them.
 * This matches the security philosophy used in Firestore rules.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All files are stored under /users/{userId}/, with subdirectories for ifcModels. This hierarchy enforces clear ownership.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access files in their own directory.
 * - All write operations require a verified, authenticated user.
 * - File paths must match the authenticated user's ID.
 *
 * @principle Enforces file ownership and prevents unauthorized file access.
