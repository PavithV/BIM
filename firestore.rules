/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for BIMCoach Studio.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for all data. Each user has full control over their own data tree.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The Firestore database is structured as follows:
 *   /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information, with the userId matching the Firebase Auth UID.
 *   /users/{userId}/ifcModels/{ifcModelId}: Stores IFC models uploaded by each user.
 *   /users/{userId}/ifcModels/{ifcModelId}/analysisResults/{analysisResultId}: Stores analysis results associated with IFC models.
 *   /users/{userId}/messages/{messageId}: Stores chat messages associated with a user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only read and write their own data.
 * - Data consistency is enforced between the path and the document's internal userId field.
 * - Listing of user documents is disallowed (to prevent user enumeration).
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The `userId` is present both in the document path and as a field within the documents themselves, enabling efficient ownership checks without additional reads.
