/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for BIMCoach Studio.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model, ensuring that users can only access and modify data that belongs to them.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All data is nested under /users/{userId}, with subcollections for ifcModels and messages. This hierarchy enforces clear ownership.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only list their own documents.
 * - Data validation is minimal in this prototyping phase, focusing on authorization.
 * - All write operations require a verified, authenticated user.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  -The userId is used in the path for both `ifcModels` and `messages`, and is checked against `request.auth.uid`.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 *  - Draft vs. Published content is not explicitly separated, so the current rules apply to all data under the user's path.
